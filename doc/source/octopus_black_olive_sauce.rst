==============================

Background
----------
This is a Peruvian dish in the 1950s introduced by Rosita Yimura, a Pervuian from Japanese descent. If it a dish that fuses the Peruvian and Japenese cuisines.

Ingredients
-----------

- Octupus: 1 kg
- Red onion: 1 (small)
- Bayleaf: 3
- Salt: 1 tablespoon
- Black pepper: 1 teaspoon
- Lemon juice: 2 tablespoon
- Mayonaise: 3 tablespoon
- Black olive sauce: 5 tablespoon

    + alternative: black olives, mixed, without seed: 150 g

- Optional:

    + parsley, for decoration

Note:

    A fresh octopus has a lot of intact fibre, which means that it needs mechanical tenderization (pounding it repeatedly). For this reason, frozen octupus may be recommended.

Steps
-----
#. Cut the onion in 4 parts
#. Boil 2.5 l of water with the salt, bayleaf and cut onion
#. Clean the octopus. Its brain should have already been removed when you bought it.
#. When the water poils, hold the octopus with a fork and submerge it in the water for 20 seconds, then remove it. Repeat 3 times. If the octopus was frozen, make sure that the water is boiling each time the octupus is placed in the water
#. Now that the octopus has been cooked, remove the beak (between the tentacles) and eyes (if present). Place the octopus on a plate and let it cool
#. When the octopus has cooled down, cut it in pieces of about half a centimeter thickness.
#. Use a bowl to make the cream sauce by mixing the mayonaise, lemon juice, the black pepper, and the black olive sauce.
#. To serve, for each person: place the octopus on a plate and place the sauce on top. Optionally decorate with parsley.
